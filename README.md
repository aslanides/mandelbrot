# Mandelbrot

Messing around with Typescript.

## Set-up

Note: this assumes you have a recent version of [node](nodejs.org) installed.

To install dependencies:

```
npm install
```

This will install [parcel](parceljs.org), which is used to serve the page.

To run locally:

```
npm run serve
```

Then click anywhere on the page to zoom.
